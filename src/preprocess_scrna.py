====================
Preprocessing pipeline for scPerturb-seq data.

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR:
----------------------
The project requires a "curated multimodal training corpus derived from 
the Perturbation Catalogue, including scPerturb-seq perturbation-response 
profiles." This file builds exactly that — it takes raw single-cell 
perturbation data and converts it into training examples an LLM can learn from.

BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT:
-------------------
scPerturb-seq (single-cell Perturbation sequencing) is an experimental 
technology that combines two things:

  1. CRISPR knockout — breaking one specific gene in each cell
  2. scRNA-seq — reading the activity level of every gene in that cell

The result: for each cell, you know WHICH gene was knocked out AND 
HOW the rest of the genome responded. This is the richest perturbation
data type available — it captures the full transcriptional consequence
of each perturbation at single-cell resolution.

The key output of this file is the PERTURBATION DELTA — the difference
in gene expression between perturbed cells and normal cells. This delta
is the biological ground truth that the LLM learns to predict.

PROJECT CONNECTION:
-------------------
- Supports: "Encoding perturbation experiments into LLM-friendly representations"
- Produces: scPerturb-seq perturbation-response profiles for the training corpus
- Enables: "What happens if gene X is knocked out in cell type Y?" queries

# ── STEP 1: QUALITY CONTROL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Before we touch the biology, we need to throw out bad cells.
# 
# When you run a scRNA-seq experiment, not everything in your sample
# is a real healthy cell. Some "cells" are actually:
#   - Empty droplets that captured ambient RNA floating in solution
#   - Dying or dead cells that have lost most of their RNA
#   - Doublets — two cells that got captured together and look like one
#
# If you train on data from dying cells, your model learns what dying
# cells look like, not what perturbations do. That's useless.
#
# Two filters catch most of the garbage:
#   1. Minimum genes detected — real cells express hundreds of genes.
#      If a "cell" only has 50 genes detected, it's probably an empty droplet.
#   2. Mitochondrial fraction — when a cell is dying, it loses cytoplasmic
#      RNA but mitochondrial RNA stays behind (mitochondria have their own
#      membrane). So a cell with >20% mitochondrial reads is probably dying.

#
# But if control cells show 7.5 for that same gene, and perturbed cells
# show 5.2 — now we know something. The perturbation suppressed that gene
# by 2.3 units. That's a real signal.
#
# The delta (perturbed - control) is always a comparison.
# It answers: relative to a normal cell, what changed?
#
# Positive delta = gene got MORE active after knockout
# Negative delta = gene got LESS active after knockout
# Near zero = knockout didn't affect this gene
#
# Why does knocking OUT a gene make other genes MORE active?
# Because many genes are repressors — they actively suppress other genes.
# Remove the repressor and the suppressed gene is free to turn on.
# This is gene regulation in action.

# direction and magnitude as text.
#
# What we lose: the other 19,900 genes, quantitative precision,
# and coordinated small shifts across whole pathways.
#
# What we keep: the strongest signal, in a format the LLM can process.

# This is a deliberate tradeoff — start simple, establish a baseline,
# then move to richer representations if the baseline is insufficient.
# That's good research methodology.
